# Java: Not &nbsp;:coffee:
This mod we'll be writing code in Java. \
According to the internets Java is:\
>"Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible." \
Much clear, very little prohibitive vocabulary.

### An analogy
The best way to think of most programming languages is, exactly that, **a language**.
Let's take this to it's logical extent &nbsp;:rocket:

###### A story
> You are a voyager who just travelled to the Republic of Programmus.  It's a large country but they all speak the same language, Programmian. 
> You happen to be in western Programmus known for its unique dialect, Java. Central Programmus is known for its smooth Python speakers, while Northern
> Programmus is known for its very terse C speakers. Java has the same basic parts of speech and functions as other Programmian dialects, but 
> like any accent or dialect, it looks and sounds a bit different.

So aside from that being _irresponsibly nerdy_, it's actually a reasonable & non-scary way to think about programming.
