# Java: Not &nbsp;:coffee:
This mod we'll be writing code in Java. \
According to the internets Java is:
>"Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible." 

Much clear, very little prohibitive vocabulary.

### An analogy
The best way to think of most programming languages is, exactly that, **a language**.
Let's take this to it's logical extent &nbsp;:rocket:

###### A story
> You are a voyager who just travelled to the Republic of Programmus.  It's a large country but they all speak the same language, Programmian. 
> You happen to be in western Programmus known for its unique dialect, Java. Central Programmus is known for its smooth Python speakers, while Northern
> Programmus is known for its very terse C speakers. Java has the same basic parts of speech and functions as other Programmian dialects, but 
> like any accent or dialect, it looks and sounds a bit different.

So aside from that being _irresponsibly nerdy_, it's actually a reasonable & non-scary way to think about programming.\
I urge you to keep that analogy in mind when you feel bogged down by unfamiliar symbols.

### A history (unceremoniously pawned from Wikipedia)
No computer science course is complete with a bit of completely forgettable history that you'll never be tested on.
*skips section*
Anyways, Java was originally developed for TV remotes. What? Yes. Programming TV remotes. The 90s were weird.\
The whole idea behind Java, which is both mildly interesting and important is this acronym: WORA\
It stands for: Write Once, Run Anywhere. There was a big issue in the 90s that not all programming languages could run on all computers. The dudes (yes, dudes, again, it was the 90s) that made Java had unintentionally made a huge leap forward. By designing a programming language for a variety of TVs, they'd discovered a way to make programming work on all computers (with a few tweaks here and there).  Java then became the biggest hottest thing in computer programming (which is to say irrelevant to mostly everyone) and made those dudes pretty rich. Fast forward 3 decades, a White House scandal or two and Java is still a big player in the game.  To continue my love for analogies, Java is a bit like J-Lo these days.  She can still kill a Super Bowl but she's not topping any Spotify charts.

### Use cases
In the real world Java is used for:
  - [x] Maintaining old code
    - Java's age means many old applications were written in Java, so understanding it is useful to understanding the "historical record" of software
  - [x] Writing stuff for Android
    - Most of Android (the thing that isn't an iPhone) is written in Java
  - [x]
